# Iris-Flower-Classification

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Based on the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, I trained the Logistic Regression machine learning model to learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.
